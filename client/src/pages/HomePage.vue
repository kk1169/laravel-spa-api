                        tasks, assign them to team members, and set deadlines.

                        Collaboration and communication: Task management tools
                        often include features that facilitate collaboration
                        among team members. They may offer features such as
                        comments, file attachments, and activity feeds to
                        promote effective communication and seamless
                        collaboration.

                        task assignments, or any changes made to tasks. This
                        helps in staying on top of tasks and avoiding missed
                        deadlines.

                        Progress visualization: Task management tools often
                        provide visual representations, such as progress bars or
                        Kanban boards, to display the status of tasks and
                        projects at a glance. This aids in quickly assessing
                        project status and identifying areas that need
                        attention.

                        Integration and automation: Many task management tools
                        integrate with other productivity tools and
                        applications, such as calendars, email clients, or
                        project management platforms. This allows for seamless
                        data synchronization and automates certain tasks,
                        reducing manual effort.
